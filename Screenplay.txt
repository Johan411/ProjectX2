Nimbo : "Hello perfectly vague strangers! Mind telling me where I am?"

Mob : "What the hell are you doin' out so late, kid?"

Nimbo : "Um, adventure-ing?"

Mob : " Oh!! An adventurer, eh? Haahhaha.. You looking to get yo'self killed?"

Nimbo : "Killed? Why? What's out there?"

Mob : " Oh, you're not from around here are ya, Mr. Adventurer?"

Nimbo : "No, where I'm from, people talk without spitting in each others faces!"

Mob : "Oh-ho! I'm kinda likin' ya, Mr. Adventurer! You have a name?"

Nimbo : " It's John Doe. But Mr. Adventurer has a good ring to it too!"

Mob : " Doe? John Doe? You're Doe?! You'll indeed get yo'self killed, Doe! And we'll be the ones to do it!"

Nimbo : "Uh-oh! I think this has suddenly turned into an infinite runner game! Let's run!!"

4. The Sage Stage - Convo - Bloated sprites and text boxes

(Fade in)

Nimbo : "Phew! What a murderous mob! Good thing that I now have the safety of this dark and mysterious crib!"

Sage : "You're 3 seconds late! Must be temporal displacement!"

Nimbo : "Whoa, that's a creepy voice!!"

Sage : "When you've aged like me, I'd wager your voice sounds exactly like mine too!"

Nimbo : "Then I'll make a special effort not to scare off people by inhabiting dark, creepy cribs!"

Sage : " Aah! But you'll have little choice then! All that's left in this version of time are these small, dark shelters."

Nimbo : " What... happened here?"

Sage : "To put it bluntly, apocalypse."

Nimbo : "Apocalypse?! Did I sleep through it?"

Sage : "No, you skipped it."

Nimbo : "What does that mean?"

Sage : "You were thrown forward in time, John. Almost 50 years. This, is year 2066, or somewhere close to that... I think."

Nimbo : "Ti..Time? This.. This is my future?!"

Sage : "Yes, it is. Not what you hoped for, is it?"

Nimbo : "So I don't get to be a revolutionary astronomer who'll finally discover aliens?!"

Sage : "Do you really want to know?"

Nimbo : "What difference does it make now? I'm stuck here anyway."

Sage : "What if I told you... You could set this right?"

Nimbo : "I'd call you crazy, unless you have a time machine lying around, hehe."

Sage : "I do."

Nimbo : "You're crazy."

Sage : "I might be. But this crazy man is offering you a choice - reclaim your past or go back out there. Make the choice, John."

(Two buttons : "Go Past", "Go Back")

Case 'Go Back' - Sage : "Very Well! I'll see you in approximately fifteen minutes then!"

Case 'Go Past' -

Sage : "Good choice! There's a prerequisite to time travel, however."

Nimbo : "Oh! 'Conditions Apply*', eh?"

Sage : " More a safety precaution. Here, take these cortisol tablets. They help manage the stress time travel puts on your body. But..."

Nimbo : "There's a 'but' too? You are terrible at really selling your idea, you know?!"

Sage : "... But it can cause hallucinations... It probably will the first time!"

Nimbo : " So it will cause me to have a dream? Huh! You really had me worried!"

Sage : "Go on, swallow it then!"

Nimbo : "Let's see what my inner demons are... "

5. Exposition - text floating in the sky

Now, look here, John. I'll tell you what happened. It was 2032. A promising young scientist had done it. "Finally!" He had screamed. "Time is now in my hands!".
He'd done it, created the very first time-machine. At 10:47:33 am, on September 29, 2032 - that ill fated moment - he pressed the switch. The disturbance in the
space-time continuum cause by it was so great, that time itself lost it's course. The ripples in space-time cause events so cataclysmic, the earth was subject to a
mass extinction. The Magnetic field dwindled, creatures died, radiation rained down hard. And what you've seen, is what's left of the earth. All clocks stopped at that
moment, they still show 10:47:33. That is the butterflies' wings that caused the storm. You, my boy, is the only one who can clip those wings. Stop him, save everyone,
Save yourself.
