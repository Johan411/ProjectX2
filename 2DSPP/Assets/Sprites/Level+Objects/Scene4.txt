Now, look here, John. I'll tell you what happened. It was 2032. A promising young scientist had done it. "Finally!" He had screamed. "Time is now in my hands!".
He'd done it, created the very first time-machine. At 10:47:33 am, on September 29, 2032 - that ill fated moment - he pressed the switch. The disturbance in the
space-time continuum cause by it was so great, that time itself lost it's course. The ripples in space-time cause events so cataclysmic, the earth was subject to a
mass extinction. The Magnetic field dwindled, creatures died, radiation rained down hard. And what you've seen, is what's left of the earth. All clocks stopped at that
moment, they still show 10:47:33. That is the butterflies' wings that caused the storm. You, my boy, is the only one who can clip those wings. Stop him, save everyone,
Save yourself.
