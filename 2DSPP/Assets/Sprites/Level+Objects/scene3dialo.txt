Nimbo : 
Phew! What a murderous mob! Good thing that I now have the safety of this dark and mysterious crib!
Sage :
You're 3 seconds late! Must be temporal displacement!
Nimbo :
Whoa, that's a creepy voice!!
Sage :
When you've aged like me, I'd wager your voice sounds exactly like mine too!
Nimbo :
Then I'll make a special effort not to scare off people by inhabiting dark, creepy cribs!
Sage :
Aah! But you'll have little choice then! All that's left in this version of time are these small, dark shelters.
Nimbo :
What... happened here?
Sage :
To put it bluntly, apocalypse.
Nimbo :
Apocalypse?! Did I sleep through it?
Sage :
No, you skipped it.
Nimbo :
What does that mean?
Sage : 
You were thrown forward in time, John. Almost 50 years. This, is year 2066, or somewhere close to that... I think.
Nimbo : 
Ti..Time? This.. This is my future?!
Sage : 
Yes, it is. Not what you hoped for, is it?
Nimbo : 
So I don't get to be a revolutionary astronomer who'll finally discover aliens?!
Sage :
Do you really want to know?
Nimbo : 
What difference does it make now? I'm stuck here anyway.
Sage :
What if I told you... You could set this right?
Nimbo :
I'd call you crazy, unless you have a time machine lying around, hehe.
Sage : 
I do.
Nimbo : 
You're crazy.
Sage : 
I might be. But this crazy man is offering you a choice - reclaim your past or go back out there. Make the choice, John.

Sage :
Very Well! I'll see you in approximately fifteen minutes then!
//Case 'Go Past' -
Sage : 
Good choice! There's a prerequisite to time travel, however.
Nimbo :
Oh! 'Conditions Apply*', eh?
Sage : 
More a safety precaution. Here, take these cortisol tablets. They help manage the stress time travel puts on your body. But...
Nimbo : 
There's a 'but' too? You are terrible at really selling your idea, you know?!
Sage : 
... But it can cause hallucinations... It probably will the first time!
Nimbo : 
So it will cause me to have a dream? Huh! You really had me worried!
Sage : 
Go on, swallow it then!
Nimbo : 
Let's see what my inner demons are...
